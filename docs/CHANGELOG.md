Each release's notes are the section for its version below; `scripts/release.sh --publish` uses them as the GitHub release notes.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-10-15

First release.

- One window showing every self-hosted GitHub Actions runner on this Mac, other Macs over SSH, and inside Colima VMs: state, current job and step, CPU and memory, and the shared queue.
- Flags stalls (silent log and idle CPU), failures (with the failed step and a link to the job), jobs that no online runner can take, low disk space and runners behind the latest runner release.
- Notifications for stalls, failures and unexpected outages; a Dock badge counts runners that need attention.
- Restart and Drain/Resume per runner, with a check that a restarted runner comes back.
- A Capacity window with 24 hours of runner use and queue length.
- Test connection in Settings, optional launch at login and quiet hours for non-urgent alerts.
